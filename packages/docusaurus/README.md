## Introduction

Docusaurus is a project for building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites easily.

- **Simple to Start**

> Docusaurus is built in a way so that it can [get running](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation/) in as little time as possible. We've built Docusaurus to handle the website build process so you can focus on your project.

- **Localizable**

> Docusaurus ships with [localization support](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/translation/) via CrowdIn. Empower and grow your international community by translating your documentation.

- **Customizable**

> While Docusaurus ships with the key pages and sections you need to get started, including a home page, a docs section, a [blog](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/blog), and additional support pages, it is also [customizable](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages) as well to ensure you have a site that is [uniquely yours](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/api-pages/).

## Installation

We have released the [`@docusaurus/init` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docusaurus/init) to make [getting started](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/) with Docusaurus easy.

## Contributing

We've released Docusaurus because it helps us better scale and supports the many OSS projects at Facebook. We hope that other organizations can benefit from the project. We are thankful for any contributions from the community.
