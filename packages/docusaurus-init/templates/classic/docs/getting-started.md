## Setting up the development environment

### Step 1:  Generate a Docusaurus site

If you haven't already, generate a new Docusaurus site using the classic template:

```shell
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-documentation classic
```

### Step 2: Start your Docusaurus site

Run the development server:

```shell
npx docusaurus start
```

Open `docs/getting-started.md` and edit some lines. The site should reload automatically and display your changes.

### That's it!

Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your Docusaurus project.
