<p><em>“Joel and I were discussing having a website and how it would have been great to launch with it. So I challenged myself to add Docusaurus support. It took just over an hour and a half. I'm going to send you a PR with the addition so you can take a look and see if you like it. Your workflow for adding docs wouldn't be much different from editing those markdown files.”</em></p>

<p>This is the story of the rather short journey it took to create the <a href="https://facebookincubator.github.io/profilo/">Profilo</a> website using Docusaurus.</p>
<p>Profilo, an Android library for collecting performance traces from production, <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/356115241551826/profilo-understanding-app-performance-in-the-wild/">was announced</a> earlier this year. The project was <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/tree/802042f90f990998a272387e371b893af52465b8">published on GitHub</a> with a less than <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/tree/802042f90f990998a272387e371b893af52465b8/docs">a handful or Markdown files</a> to describe its functionality and no website to showcase any branding and highlight the logo. The task at hand was to turn these existing docs and logo into a website.</p>

<p>We are very happy to introduce <a href="https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus">Docusaurus</a> to help you manage one or many open source websites.</p>
<p>We created <a href="https://docusaurus.io">Docusaurus</a> for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>To put the focus on writing good documentation instead of worrying about the infrastructure of a website.</li>
<li>To provide features that many of our open source websites need like blog support, search and versioning.</li>
<li>To make it easy to push updates, new features, and bug fixes to everyone all at once.</li>
<li>And, finally, to provide a consistent look and feel across all of our open source projects.</li>
</ol>
