Today we are extremely happy to finally **announce Docusaurus 3.0**! 🥳

This is a new **major version** of Docusaurus, coming with **new exciting features** and upgraded dependencies.

We respect [**Semantic Versioning**](https://semver.org/) and this release also includes **breaking changes** that we documented thoroughly in the [**v3 upgrade guide**](/docs/3.0.0-rc.0/migration/v3). Breaking changes can be annoying, but are necessary to set the ground for a new wave of Docusaurus features that we plan to implement later.

We initially planned to release more frequent major versions, but this one has taken longer than expected. **Upgrading to [MDX v2](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2/) is the main challenge** to the adoption of this new version. We went the extra mile to make this upgrade as easy as possible, notably by adding [compatibility options for MDX v1](/docs/3.0.0-rc.0/api/docusaurus-config#markdown).

The simplest sites will only need to upgrade a few npm dependencies. For more complex sites, we came up with a few strategies than can help you upgrade more confidently:

- [prepare your site](/blog/preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3) ahead of time, incrementally, while staying under Docusaurus v2
- [set up visual regression tests](/blog/upgrading-frontend-dependencies-with-confidence-using-visual-regression-testing) to catch unexpected visual changes happening during the upgrade

## Highlights

### Breaking changes

This section only gives you a quick glance. All the breaking changes are thoroughly documented on the [**v3 upgrade guide**](/docs/3.0.0-rc.0/migration/v3).

Docusaurus v3 upgraded a few dependencies to new major versions, each coming with their own breaking changes:

- Node.js v16 ➡️ v18
- React v17 ➡️ v18
- MDX v1 ➡️ v2
- TypeScript v4 ➡️ v5
- Prism-React-Renderer v1 ➡️ v2
- React-live v2 ➡️ v4
- Mermaid v9 ➡️ v10
- import-fresh v3 ➡️ jiti v1

A typical `package.json` dependency upgrade looks like:

```diff title="package.json"
 {
   "dependencies": {
     // upgrade to Docusaurus v3
-    "@docusaurus/core": "2.4.3",
-    "@docusaurus/preset-classic": "2.4.3",
+    "@docusaurus/core": "3.0.0",
+    "@docusaurus/preset-classic": "3.0.0",
     // upgrade to MDX v2
-    "@mdx-js/react": "^1.6.22",
+    "@mdx-js/react": "^2.3.0",
     // upgrade to prism-react-renderer v2.0+
-    "prism-react-renderer": "^1.3.5",
+    "prism-react-renderer": "^2.1.0",
     // upgrade to React v18.0+
-    "react": "^17.0.2",
-    "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
+    "react": "^18.2.0",
+    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
   },
   "devDependencies": {
     // upgrade Docusaurus dev dependencies to v3
-    "@docusaurus/module-type-aliases": "2.4.3"
-    "@docusaurus/types": "2.4.3"
+    "@docusaurus/module-type-aliases": "3.0.0"
+    "@docusaurus/types": "3.0.0"
   }
   "engines": {
     // require Node.js 18.0+
-    "node": ">=16.14"
+    "node": ">=18.0"
   }
 }
```

Apart MDX v2, most breaking changes coming with those upgraded dependencies have been handled internally for you: most of the time, you shouldn't have to do anything. Outside dependencies, the only functional breaking changes coming explicitly from the Docusaurus codebase are:

- [#9189](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9189): new default blog RSS feed limit of 20 entries
- [#9308](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9308): fix and re-introduce the `:::warning` admonition, deprecate `:::caution`
- [#9310](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9310): remove the legacy versioned sidebar id prefix, used for sites versioned before `v2.0.0-beta.10` (December 2021)
- [#7966](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/7966): refactor docs theme components, eventually requiring to you re-swizzle them

:::warning MDX v2 - the main challenge

The [**upgrade to MDX v2**](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2/) is the main upgrade challenge. Some documents that compiled successfully under Docusaurus v2 might now **fail to compile** under Docusaurus v3, while others might **render differently**.

**Don't be intimidated**, most problems are **easy to fix** and often related to `{` and `<` characters that you now need to escape. However, depending on the size of your site, you might need to edit many files and feel overwhelmed. For this reason we provide a command [`npx docusaurus-mdx-checker`](https://github.com/slorber/docusaurus-mdx-checker) to help you get an estimate of the work to be done, and we recommend to [prepare your site in advance](/blog/preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3).

If you created custom [MDX plugins](/docs/markdown-features/plugins) (Remark/Rehype), the AST is slightly different, and you might need to refactor them.
