We are happy announce **Docusaurus 2.1**, our very first minor version release.

As explained in the [Docusaurus 2.0 release blog post](/blog/2022/08/01/announcing-docusaurus-2.0) and our [release process documentation](/community/release-process), minor versions **respect [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)**, and the upgrade should be quite easy.
