# Overview

This documentation will help you upgrade your site from Docusaurus v2 to Docusaurus v3.

:::tip Prepare your site for Docusaurus v3

Before upgrading, we recommend [**preparing your site for Docusaurus v3**](/blog/preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3) in advance.

There are changes that you can already **handle incrementally, while staying on Docusaurus v2**. Doing so will help reduce the work needed to upgrade to Docusaurus v3.
