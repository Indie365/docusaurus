Example:

```yml title="tags.yml"
tag:
tag1: null
# both tag above are equivalent
docusaurus: # what you'll be using in the front matter
  label: Docusaurus
  permalink: /docusaurus
  description: Things related to Docusaurus
```

Only the key are required. If values are not provided the label will be set to the key Capitalized and the permalink will be set to the key kebab-cased.
