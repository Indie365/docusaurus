Docusaurus supports search engine optimization in a variety of ways.

## Global metadata {#global-metadata}

Provide global meta attributes for the entire site through the [site configuration](./configuration.md#site-metadata). The metadatas will all be rendered in the HTML `<head>` using the key-value pairs as the prop name and value.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  themeConfig: {
    metadatas: [{name: 'keywords', content: 'cooking, blog'}],
    // This would become <meta name="keywords" content="cooking, blog"> in the generated HTML
  },
};
```

To read more about types of meta tags, visit [the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta).

## Single page metadata {#single-page-metadata}

Similarly to [global metadata](#global-metadata), Docusaurus also allows for addition of meta information on single pages. In order to add metadata to single page follow [this guide](./guides/markdown-features/markdown-features-head-metadatas.mdx) for head tag extension.

## Static HTML generation {#static-html-generation}

Docusaurus is a static site generatorâ€”HTML files are statically generated for every URL route, which helps search engines discover your content easier.

## Image meta description {#image-meta-description}

Docusaurus supports alt tags for your images, see [this section](./guides/markdown-features/markdown-features-assets.mdx#images) for more details.

## Rich search information {#rich-search-information}

Docusaurus blogs support [rich search results](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) out-of-the-box in order to get maximum search engine experience. The information is created depending on your meta information in blog/global configuration. In order to get the benefits of the rich search information, fill in the information about the post's publish date, authors, and image, etc. Read more about the meta information [here](./blog.mdx).

## Robots file {#robots-file}

To add a `robots.txt` file which regulates search engines' behavior about which should be displayed and which shouldn't, provide it as [static asset](./static-assets.md). The following would allow access to all sub-pages from all requests:

```text title="static/robots.txt"
User-agent: *
Disallow:
```

Read more about robots file in [the Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro).

:::caution

**Important**: the `robots.txt` file does **not** prevent HTML pages from being indexed. Use `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` as [page metadata](#single-page-metadata) to prevent it from appearing in search results entirely.

:::

## Sitemap file {#sitemap-file}

Docusaurus provides the [`@docusaurus/plugin-sitemap`](./api/plugins/plugin-sitemap.md) plugin, which is shipped wih `preset-classic` by default. It autogenerates a `sitemap.xml` file which will be available at `https://example.com/<baseUrl>/sitemap.xml` after the production build. This sitemap metadata helps search engine crawlers crawl your site more accurately.

## Human readable links {#human-readable-links}

Docusaurus uses your file names as links, but you can always change that using slugs, see this [tutorial](./guides/docs/docs-introduction.md#document-id) for more details.

## Structured content {#structured-content}

Docusaurus provides you with option to structure your content in terms of how your data are presented in search engine see this [configuration option](./guides/markdown-features/markdown-features-head-metadatas.mdx). The structure of the site itself is rigid through specification of [common markdown](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#atx-headings), this makes it easier for the search engines to classify and read your content. By using Markdown consistently in your project you will make it easy for search engines to understand your content.
