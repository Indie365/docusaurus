The blog feature enables you to deploy in no time a full-featured blog.

:::info

Check the [Blog Plugin API Reference documentation](./api/plugins/plugin-content-blog.md) for an exhaustive list of options.

:::

## Initial setup {#initial-setup}

To setup your site's blog, start by creating a `blog` directory.

Then, add an item link to your blog within `docusaurus.config.js`:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  themeConfig: {
    // ...
    navbar: {
      items: [
        // ...
        // highlight-next-line
        {to: 'blog', label: 'Blog', position: 'left'}, // or position: 'right'
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

## Adding posts {#adding-posts}

To publish in the blog, create a Markdown file within the blog directory.

For example, create a file at `my-website/blog/2019-09-05-hello-docusaurus-v2.md`:

```yml
---
title: Welcome Docusaurus v2
author: Joel Marcey
author_title: Co-creator of Docusaurus 1
author_url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey
author_image_url: https://graph.facebook.com/611217057/picture/?height=200&width=200
tags: [hello, docusaurus-v2]
description: This is my first post on Docusaurus 2.

Welcome to this blog. This blog is created with [**Docusaurus 2**](https://docusaurus.io/).

<!--truncate-->

This is my first post on Docusaurus 2.

A whole bunch of exploration to follow.
```

:::note

Docusaurus will extract a `YYYY-MM-DD` date from a file/folder name such as `YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post-title.md`.

This naming convention is optional, and you can provide the date as FrontMatter.

:::tip

Using a folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images alongside the Markdown file.

:::

The only required field in the front matter is `title`; however, we provide options to add more metadata to your blog post, for example, author information. For all possible fields, see [the API documentation](api/plugins/plugin-content-blog.md#markdown-frontmatter).

## Blog list {#blog-list}

The blog's index page (by default, it is at `/blog`) is the _blog list page_, where all blog posts are collectively displayed.

Use the `<!--truncate-->` marker in your blog post to represent what will be shown as the summary when viewing all published blog posts. Anything above `<!--truncate-->` will be part of the summary. For example:

```yml
---
title: Truncation Example
---
All these will be part of the blog post summary.

Even this.

<!--truncate-->

But anything from here on down will not be.

Not this.

Or this.
```

By default, 10 posts are shown on each blog list page, but you can control pagination with the `postsPerPage` option in the plugin configuration. If you set `postsPerPage: 'ALL'`, pagination will be disabled and all posts will be displayed on the first page. You can also add meta description to the blog list page for better SEO:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        blog: {
          // highlight-start
          blogTitle: 'Docusaurus blog!',
          blogDescription: 'A Docusaurus powered blog!',
          postsPerPage: 'ALL',
          // highlight-end
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

## Blog sidebar {#blog-sidebar}

The blog sidebar displays recent blog posts. The default number of items shown is 5, but you can customize with the `blogSidebarCount` option in the plugin configuration. By setting `blogSidebarCount: 0`, the sidebar will be completely disabled, with the container removed as well. This will increase the width of the main container. Specially, if you have set `blogSidebarCount: 'ALL'`, _all_ posts will be displayed.

You can also alter the sidebar heading text with the `blogSidebarTitle` option. For example, if you have set `blogSidebarCount: 'ALL'`, instead of the default "Recent posts", you may would rather make it say "All posts":

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        blog: {
          // highlight-start
          blogSidebarTitle: 'All posts',
          blogSidebarCount: 'ALL',
          // highlight-end
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

## Blog post author {#blog-post-author}

Docusaurus supports multiple author declaration patterns in the front matter:

- Simple string fields;
- An author object;
- A list of multiple author objects.

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  defaultValue="strings"
  groupId="author-format"
  values={[
    {label: 'String fields', value: 'strings'},
    {label: 'Single author object', value: 'object'},
    {label: 'Multiple authors', value: 'multiple'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="strings">

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
author: Joel Marcey
author_title: Co-creator of Docusaurus 1
author_url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey
author_image_url: https://graph.facebook.com/611217057/picture/?height=200&width=200
---
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="object">

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
author:
  name: Joel Marcey
  title: Co-creator of Docusaurus 1
  url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey
  image_url: https://graph.facebook.com/611217057/picture/?height=200&width=200
---
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="multiple">

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
authors:
  - name: Joel Marcey
    title: Co-creator of Docusaurus 1
    url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey
    image_url: https://graph.facebook.com/611217057/picture/?height=200&width=200
  - name: Sébastien Lorber
    title: Docusaurus maintainer
    url: https://sebastienlorber.com
    image_url: https://github.com/slorber.png
---
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

:::caution

The object format and multiple authors currently only support referencing images using URLs. Only the string fields format allows referencing the author's image using file-system relative paths (e.g. `author_image_url: ./img/avatar.png`).

:::

Alternatively, you can supply default values for the author profile through a global author map. The file should be a map from string keys to author objects, in either JSON or YAML format:

```yml title="authors.yml"
JMarcey:
  name: Joel Marcey
  title: Technical Lead and Developer Advocate at Facebook
Endi:
  name: Endilie Yacop Sucipto
  url: https://github.com/endiliey
slorber:
  name: Sébastien Lorber
  title: Docusaurus maintainer
  url: https://sebastienlorber.com
  image_url: https://github.com/slorber.png
```

And then, in the blog front matter, you can reference the author's profile with the `author_key`:

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  defaultValue="strings"
  groupId="author-format"
  values={[
    {label: 'String fields', value: 'strings'},
    {label: 'Single author object', value: 'object'},
    {label: 'Multiple authors', value: 'multiple'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="strings">

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
author_key: slorber
---
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="object">

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
author_key: slorber
---
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="multiple">

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
author_keys:
  - JMarcey
  - slorber
---
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

You can override any of the global profile information by redefining the author. The local front matter will always take precedence, and only those undefined values will be substituted with the global information.

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  defaultValue="strings"
  groupId="author-format"
  values={[
    {label: 'String fields', value: 'strings'},
    {label: 'Single author object', value: 'object'},
    {label: 'Multiple authors', value: 'multiple'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="strings">

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
author_key: slorber
author_url: https://github.com/slorber
---
```

The above front matter is equivalent to:

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
author: Sébastien Lorber
author_title: Docusaurus maintainer
author_url: https://github.com/slorber
author_image_url: https://github.com/slorber.png
---
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="object">

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
author_key: slorber
author:
  url: https://github.com/slorber
---
```

The above front matter is equivalent to:

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
author:
  name: Sébastien Lorber
  title: Docusaurus maintainer
  url: https://github.com/slorber
  image_url: https://github.com/slorber.png
---
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="multiple">

Multiple authors will be handled one-to-one. Since `author_keys` only supply default values, you can even have more authors than the length of `author_keys`:

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
author_keys:
  - slorber
authors:
  -
  - name: Joel Marcey
    title: Technical Lead and Developer Advocate at Facebook
---
```

The above front matter is equivalent to:

```yml title="some-blogpost.md"
---
authors:
  - name: Sébastien Lorber
    title: Docusaurus maintainer
    url: https://sebastienlorber.com
    image_url: https://github.com/slorber.png
  - name: Joel Marcey
    title: Technical Lead and Developer Advocate at Facebook
---
```

:::note

The authors in `author_keys` always come before the additional authors in `authors`.

:::

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

:::caution

The plurals must match. `author_key` should be only used with `author`, and `author_keys` should only be used with `authors`. The difference is that singulars only accept single objects and plurals only accept arrays.

:::

By default, this author map file should be at `<your-blog-path>/authors.yml` (i.e., in the same folder as all the other Markdown files), but you can configure it through plugin options.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        blog: {
          // highlight-next-line
          authorsMapPath: 'data/authors.json',
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

<details>
  <summary>Technical details for site builders</summary>

No matter how authors are declared in front matter, the result is always normalized into the `authors` field in the blog post's metadata. If you want to render additional author information (`twitter`, etc.), object notation is more preferable than string fields (prefer `author: {twitter: 'id'}` to `author_twitter: 'id'`), because the former will be packed into metadata, while the latter will not be picked up and will stay in the front matter.

</details>

## Feed {#feed}

You can generate RSS/Atom feed by passing feedOptions. By default, RSS and Atom feeds are generated. To disable feed generation, set `feedOptions.type` to `null`.

```ts
type BlogOptions = {
  feedOptions?: {
    type?: 'rss' | 'atom' | 'all' | null;
    title?: string;
    description?: string;
    copyright: string;
    language?: string; // possible values: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/dirlang.html#langcodes
  };
};
```

Example usage:

```js {8-11} title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        blog: {
          feedOptions: {
            type: 'all',
            copyright: `Copyright © ${new Date().getFullYear()} Facebook, Inc.`,
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

Accessing the feed:

The feed for RSS can be found at:

```text
https://{your-domain}/blog/rss.xml
```

and for Atom:

```text
https://{your-domain}/blog/atom.xml
```

## Advanced topics {#advanced-topics}

### Blog-only mode {#blog-only-mode}

You can run your Docusaurus 2 site without a landing page and instead have your blog's post list page as the index page. Set the `routeBasePath` to be `'/'` to indicate it's the root path.

```js {10} title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs: false,
        blog: {
          path: './blog',
          routeBasePath: '/', // Set this value to '/'.
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

:::caution

Don't forget to delete the existing homepage at `./src/pages/index.js` or else there will be two files mapping to the same route!

:::

### Multiple blogs {#multiple-blogs}

By default, the classic theme assumes only one blog per website and hence includes only one instance of the blog plugin. If you would like to have multiple blogs on a single website, it's possible too! You can add another blog by specifying another blog plugin in the `plugins` option for `docusaurus.config.js`.

Set the `routeBasePath` to the URL route that you want your second blog to be accessed on. Note that the `routeBasePath` here has to be different from the first blog or else there could be a collision of paths! Also, set `path` to the path to the directory containing your second blog's entries.

As documented for [multi-instance plugins](./using-plugins.md#multi-instance-plugins-and-plugin-ids), you need to assign a unique id to the plugins.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog',
      {
        /**
         * Required for any multi-instance plugin
         */
        id: 'second-blog',
        /**
         * URL route for the blog section of your site.
         * *DO NOT* include a trailing slash.
         */
        routeBasePath: 'my-second-blog',
        /**
         * Path to data on filesystem relative to site dir.
         */
        path: './my-second-blog',
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

As an example, we host a second blog [here](/tests/blog).
