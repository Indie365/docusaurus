---

MDX has a built-in plugin system that can be used to customize its behavior, [see plugin documentation](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/plugins/) in official MDX docs.

You might want to customize the behavior of file translations in few ways for instance:

- using existing remark plugin ([see official remark plugin list](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins))
- using existing rehype plugin ([see official rehype plugin list](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins))
- create remark/rehype plugin to introduce new syntax to your MDX
- create remark/rehype plugin to change the HTML output for existing MDX syntax

Some use case examples of introducing new features might be:

- mathml support
- graph visualization
- sheet music generation

Changes to HTML output might be useful if you want to:

- add some additional HTML properties
- change the resulting HTML element for Markdown feature

## What are remark and rehype

Remark is a markdown processor used to parse it into the structured tree. It can be later used programmatically to transform it or compile it into output format. Complete introduction to remark can be found [here](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark).

Rehype is a similar suite of plugins working on the HTML files, capable of transforming them. Complete introduction to rehype can be found [here](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype).

## Configuring plugins {#configuring-plugins}

An MDX plugin is usually a npm package, so you install them like other npm packages using npm.

First, install your [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins) and [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins) plugins.

For example:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save remark-images
npm install --save rehype-truncate
```

Next, import the plugins:

```js
const remarkImages = require('remark-images');
const rehypeTruncate = require('rehype-truncate');
```

Finally, add them to the `@docusaurus/preset-classic` options in `docusaurus.config.js`:

```js {10,11} title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs: {
          sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebars.js'),
          // ...
          remarkPlugins: [remarkImages],
          rehypePlugins: [rehypeTruncate],
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

## Configuring plugin options {#configuring-plugin-options}

Some plugins can be configured and accept their own options. In that case, use the `[plugin, pluginOptions]` syntax, like so:

```jsx {10-13} title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs: {
          sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebars.js'),
          // ...
          remarkPlugins: [
            plugin1,
            [plugin2, {option1: {...}}],
          ],
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

See more information in the [MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/plugins).

## Creating new rehype/remark plugins

In order to create your own plugins follow those instructions for [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#creating-plugins) or [rehype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#creating-plugins).

:::tip

Docusaurus provides its own [plugins](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/docusaurus-mdx-loader/src/remark) that can be inspiration for your next plugin.
