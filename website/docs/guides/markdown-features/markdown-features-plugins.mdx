description: Using MDX plugins to expand Docusaurus Markdown functionalities
slug: /markdown-features/plugins
---

The fragment files written in Docusaurus are using the MDX format see [this link](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/) for more details about MDX. MDX itself can be easily extended with additional capabilities of translating the input text into HTML. Docusaurus content plugins support out of the box both [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) plugins that work with MDX.

However sometimes it is not enough and you might want to use some advanced features as provided in [this extensive list of plugins for remark](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins) or [another one for rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins). The plugins on this list usually provide easier, shorter or more specialized ways of creating the HTML content.

## What are remark and rehype

Remark is a markdown processor used to parse it into the structured tree that can be used programmatically to transform it or compile it into output format. Complete introduction to remark can be found [here](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark).

Rehype is a similar suite of plugins working on the HTML files, capable of transforming, minifying, it. Complete introduction to rehype can be found [here](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype).

## Configuring plugins {#configuring-plugins}

An MDX plugin is usually a npm package, so you install them like other npm packages using npm.

First, install your [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins) and [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins) plugins.

For example:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save remark-images
npm install --save rehype-truncate
```

Next, import the plugins:

```js
const remarkImages = require('remark-images');
const rehypeTruncate = require('rehype-truncate');
```

Finally, add them to the `@docusaurus/preset-classic` options in `docusaurus.config.js`:

```js {10,11} title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs: {
          sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebars.js'),
          // ...
          remarkPlugins: [remarkImages],
          rehypePlugins: [rehypeTruncate],
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

## Configuring plugin options {#configuring-plugin-options}

Some plugins can be configured and accept their own options. In that case, use the `[plugin, pluginOptions]` syntax, like so:

```jsx {10-13} title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs: {
          sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebars.js'),
          // ...
          remarkPlugins: [
            plugin1,
            [plugin2, {option1: {...}}],
          ],
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

See more information in the [MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/plugins).

## Creating own rehype or remark plugins

In order to create own plugins follow those instructions for [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#creating-plugins) or [rehype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#creating-plugins).
