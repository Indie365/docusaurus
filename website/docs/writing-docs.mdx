Documentation is one of your product's interfaces with your users. A well-written and well-organized set of docs helps your users understand your product quickly. Our alined goal here is to help your users find and understand the information they need as easily as possible.

Docusaurus 2 uses modern tooling to help you compose your interactive documentations with ease. You may embed React components, or build live coding blocks where your users may play with the code on the spot. Start sharing your eureka moments with the code your audience cannot walk away from. It is perhaps the most effective way of forming akinships with your potential users.

In this section, we'd like to introduce you to the tools we've picked that we believe will help you build a powerful documentation. Let us walk you through with an example.

## Using Markdown

Create a markdown file, `greeting.md`, and place it under the `docs` directory of your website's root.

```bash
. # root directory of your site
├── docs
│   └── greeting.md
├── pages
├── # ...
```

<!-- TODO: talk about where to put the docs, resolving docs outside of website directory, etc. -->

In the beginning of this file, specify `id`, `title`, and `sidebar_label` so that Docusaurus will pick them up correctly when generating your site. We'll talk about that again in just a minute.

```markdown
---
id: greeting
title: Hello
sidebar_label: hello
---

# Hello from Docusaurus

Are you ready to create the documentation site for your open source project?

## Headers

will show up on the table of contents on the upper right

So that your users will know what this page is all about without scrolling down or even without reading too much.

### Only h2 and h3 will be in the toc

The headers are well-spaced so that the hierarchy is clear.

- lists will help you
- present the key points
- that you want your users to remember
  - and you may nest them
    - multiple times
```

This will render as follows

## Embedding React Components

Docusaurus has in-house support for [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). This allows you to write JSX within your Markdown files and render them as React components.

**Note** While both `.md` and `.mdx` files are parsed, some of the syntax are treated slightly differently. For most accurate parsing, we recommend using `.mdx` for MDX files.

**Note** Simply rename your file extension. The hot reload server will pick it up without the need of a restart.

Try this block here:

```jsx
export const Highlighter = ({children}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      background: 'rgb(37, 194, 160)',
      padding: '2px 4px',
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: 'white',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

### <Highlighter>Docusaurus</Highlighter> green is my favorite color.
```

Notice how it renders both the markup from your React component and the Markdown syntax:

export const Highlighter = ({children}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      background: 'rgb(37, 194, 160)',
      padding: '2px 4px',
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: 'white',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<!-- TODO: Need a more standout typesetting for block quote. Using ### now -->

### <Highlighter>Docusaurus</Highlighter> green is my favorite color.

<!-- TODO: Briefly explain MDX more -->

## Sidebar

To generate a sidebar to your Docusaurus site, you need `sidebars.js` under the root directory. Our template should have already generated it for you, so you may edit it directly for customization.

<!-- TODO: change classic template to use `sidebars.js` from json -->

```bash
. # root directory of your site
├── docs
│   └── greeting.md
├── sidebars.js
```

Docusaurus will look for a `docs` field in your `sidebars.js` module exports, under which the keys will be treated as the names of each category of your docs, and the values the arrays of `id`'s you specify in your docs' frontmatter.

To add a doc to the sidebar, add the `id` specified in the frontmatter of the doc into its category.

```diff
module.exports = {
  docs: {
+   "Getting started": ["hello"],
    "Docusaurus": ["doc1"],
    "First Category": ["doc2"],
    "Second Category": ["doc3"],
  }
};
```

<!--
TODO: Talk more about using the official docs plugin and how to configure the sidebar. Mention about incorporating assets and a preview of the cool Markdown features available, but don't list all the Markdown features here.

## Syntax highlighting

Code blocks are text blocks wrapped around by strings of 3 backticks. You may check out [this reference](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification) for specifications of MDX.

    ```jsx
      console.log("Every repo must come with a mascot.");
    ```

<!-- TODO: We need to allow users to pick syntax highlighting themes (maybe other than swizzling) -->

Use the matching language meta string for your code block, and Docusaurus will pick up syntax highlighting automatically, powerd by [Prism React Renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer). Just in case you need it, [here](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages) is a list of supported languages and their corresponding meta strings.

```jsx
console.log('Every repo must come with a mascot.');
```

**Work in Progress** Currently the Prism theme we use is [Night Owl](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/themes/nightOwl.js). We will support customized theme in a future version.

## Live Editor

You can create live code editors by creating a code block with `live` attached to the language meta string.

    ```jsx live
    function Clock(props) {
      const [date, setDate] = useState(new Date());
      useEffect(() => {
        var timerID = setInterval(() => tick(), 1000);

        return function cleanup() {
          clearInterval(timerID);
        };
      });

      function tick() {
        setDate(new Date());
      }

      return (
        <div>
          <h2>It is {date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

It will render an interactive editor. Changes to the code will reflect on the result panel live.

```jsx live
function Clock(props) {
  const [date, setDate] = useState(new Date());
  useEffect(() => {
    var timerID = setInterval(() => tick(), 1000);

    return function cleanup() {
      clearInterval(timerID);
    };
  });

  function tick() {
    setDate(new Date());
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>It is {date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Work in Progress** The React Live component is rather big. We want to make it an opt-in by moving it to a plugin.
