# Community Documentation

The **[Docusaurus.community](https://docusaurus.community)** site extends the [official docs](/docs) with more complex examples and full articles that recommend best practices and provide solutions to common problems.

It is also a full Docusaurus application just like our main site, so customization and experimentation examples are perfectly suited to be hosted there.

We might allow direct links to be added in our official documentation that point to the community documentation, on a case-by-case basis, if the community finds such links to articles useful.

We are also contemplating further integration into the official documentation at some point in the future.
