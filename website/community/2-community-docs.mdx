## Community Documentation

(extends the [Official Docs](/docs))

The **[Docusaurus.community](https://docusaurus.community)** site can be used for extending the official documentation with more complex examples and full articles on best practices that provide solutions to problems the community often faces.

(It is also a full React application just like our main site. So customization and experimentation examples are perfectly suited to be hosted there.)

:::info We might allow direct links to be added in our official documentation that point to the community documentation, on a case by case basis, and as the community requests that such links to articles are useful.

We are also contemplating further integration into the official documentation at some point in the future. :::
