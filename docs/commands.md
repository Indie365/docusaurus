Docusaurus provides a set of scripts to help you generate, serve, and deploy your website. These scripts can be invoked with the `run` command when using Yarn or npm. Some common commands are:

* [`yarn run start`](commands.md#docusaurus-start-port-number): build and serve the website from a local server
* [`yarn run examples`](commands.md#docusaurus-examples): create example configuration files


## Running from the command line 

The scripts can be run using either Yarn or npm. If you've already gone through our Getting Started guide, you may already be familiar with the `start` command. It's the command that tells Docusaurus to run the `docusaurus-start` script which generates the site and starts up a server, and it's usually invoked like so:

```
yarn run start
```

The same script can be invoked using npm:

```
npm run start
```

To run a particular script, just replace the `start` command in the examples above with the command associated with your script.

## Using arguments

Some commands support optional arguments. For example, to start a server on port 8080, you can specify the `--port` argument when running `start`:

```
yarn run start --port 8080
```

If you run Docusaurus using npm, you can still use the command line arguments by inserting a `--` between `npm run <command>` and the command arguments:

```
npm run start -- --port 8080
```

## Configuration

These scripts are set up under the `"scripts"` key in your `website/package.json` file as part of the installation process. If you need help setting them up again, please refer to the [Installation guide](getting-started.md#installation).

Docusaurus provides some default mappings to allow you to run commands following Node conventions. Instead of typing `docusaurus-start` every time, you can type `yarn run start` or `npm start` to achieve the same.
